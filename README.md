# Hellow!
This is a program for describing the work of a smart home. A smart home
contains a set of devices, each of which is characterized by its
own functions and is able to provide data on request.

This is list available devices:
* Light bulb
* Teapot
* Sensor
* Stereo speaker
* Robot vacuum cleaner

*This is the same list but in other form:*
* [ ] Light bulb
* [ ] Teapot
* [ ] Sensor
* [ ] Stereo speaker
* [ ] Robot vacuum cleaner

This is *part of my code*:
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    SmartHouse.new_device(1, "Зал")
    SmartHouse.new_device(1, "Зал")
    SmartHouse.new_device(2, "Кухня")
    SmartHouse.new_device(3, "Зал")
    SmartHouse.new_device(4, "Зал")
    Terminal.menu()
```

This is a random **formula** not related to the project

$`3+3=6`$
